Try following first:

source flask/youpy3/bin/activate when on top level 
python wsgi.py

If that doesn't work, try following:

Create a virtualenv with python3 as interpreter, install packages needed and run the file to start the server as follows:

virtualenv -p path/to/interpretor <nameofvirtualenv>

source <nameofvirtualenv>/bin/activate

pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install sqlalchemy-migrate
pip install migrate

python wsgi.py (the file is on the top level, starts the server locally)
